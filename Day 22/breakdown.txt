Breakdown for Pong:

Players:
Each have a paddle that can move up and down

Scoreboard:
Shows score of each player on their respective sides
The middle is also a dotted line separating each sides.

The ball:
The ball or the "pong" is used for scoring, if the player lets it past their paddle, the other player wins a point.
Hitting back the pong seems a bit tricky, if you hit it going up it will go upwards, if you hit it with your paddle going down, it goes downwards.

Boundaries:
Boundaries of where the paddle and the ball can go.
